   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. Deploy your application:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Method 2: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard

2. Visit [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign up or log in.

3. Click "Add New" â†’ "Project".

4. Import your repository.

## Configuration Details

The deployment uses the following configuration:

- `api/server.js`: Handles server-side rendering

## Environment Variables

If your application uses environment variables, add them in the Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to the "Environment Variables" tab
3. Add your variables (matching those in your .env files)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the build logs in the Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
3. Verify your vercel.json and api/server.js files are correctly configured
