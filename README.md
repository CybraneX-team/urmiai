```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

```
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb)
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets
│   └── server/    # Server-side code
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.

## Authentication System

The dashboard includes a complete authentication system with the following features:

- Email/Password Authentication
- Social Login (Google, GitHub, Twitter/X)
- Phone Authentication with OTP
- Password Reset

### Firebase Configuration

To set up authentication, you need to configure Firebase:

1. Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication methods (Email/Password, Google, GitHub, Twitter, Phone)
3. Update the Firebase configuration in `app/config/firebase.ts` with your project's settings:

```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

### Authentication Routes

- `/login` - Login page
- `/register` - Registration page
- `/forgot-password` - Password reset page
- `/phone-auth` - Phone authentication with OTP
