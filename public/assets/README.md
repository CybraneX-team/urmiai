# Hero Section Video

Please place your `video.mp4` file in this directory to use it as the background for the hero section on the landing page.

The video will be displayed in a circular container that overlaps with the URMI.AI text logo. For best results:

1. Use a video with good contrast against dark backgrounds
2. Ideally use a video with a somewhat centered subject
3. The video should be in MP4 format
4. Dimensions should be at least 720p for good quality
5. Keep the file size reasonable (under 10MB if possible) for fast loading

The video will automatically play on loop, be muted, and have no controls visible.
